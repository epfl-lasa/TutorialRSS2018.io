<h1>Overview</h1>  
<p>This 3 hours long tutorial will introduce students to techniques used to program robots through human demonstration by using dynamical systems. We will start with an overview of existing techniques for teaching a desired behavior to robots. We will present different interfaces (haptic device, motion sensors, vision, speech, etc.) available to teach robots and discuss how they serve different purpose. The second part of the tutorial will introduce a set of techniques to modify the learned behaviors locally. We are, in particular, interested in three main scenarios; e.g. obstacles avoidance, non-contact/contact transition and defining via points. Students will be able to practice these techniques through computer-based simulations. The tutorial will end with a look-out on open research questions in the field. We provide a detailed description of the program under the DOCUMENTATION tab.</p>

<li> <h2>Instructions for participants</h2>
The tutorial has several Matlab exercises that will highlight some of the concepts presented in the tutorial. These exercises should be done on your own laptop. The code for the exercises is available in a Github repository. Follow the link below and clone the repository onto your computer. Make sure that you have a stand-alone license for Matlab, so that you can run in offline during the tutorial. </li>
